This is another conversion on linapple geared toward retropie.
Changes done by Mark Ormond.

Now needs SDL_image to compile.

Changes are as follows.

The sdl mouse cursor is disabled.

The charset40.bmp, font.bmp, and splash.bmp have now been encoded in the
main executable. So no need for these files anymore.

Added the -1 swtich for mounting and running a disk in drive 1. Usage is

linapple -1 /home/pi/Retropie/roms/apple2/Frogger.dsk



The location for linapple.conf is /opt/retropie/configs/apple2/linapple.conf
The location for Master.dsk is /opt/retropie/emulators/linapple/Master.dsk


Neither of these files are required for operation, but linapple.conf is needed to change video modes, etc.


To change location of linapple.conf edit the Registry.h file and change the line..

#define REGISTRY        "/opt/retropie/configs/apple2/linapple.conf"

To where ever and what ever you want to call the file.

To change the location of the Master.dsk edit the Applewin.cpp file and change the line.,

char *MASTER_DISK="/opt/retropie/emulators/linapple/Master.dsk";

After any changes, be sure to make clean, then make and then copy your new linapple where you need it.


Enjoy,
