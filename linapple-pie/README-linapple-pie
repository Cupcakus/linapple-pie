This is another conversion on linapple originally geared toward retropie.
Now more generic for any frontend.

Changes done by Mark Ormond.

-Changes-

Now needs SDL_image to compile.
The sdl mouse cursor is disabled.
The charset40.bmp, font.bmp, and splash.bmp have now been encoded in the main executable.
So no need for these files anymore.
Support for the following command line switches.

-1 Mount floppy image in first drive.
-2 Mount floppy image in second drive.
-r Autostart the emulation
-f Start in full screen mode
-b Benchmark and quit.

It now looks for linapple.conf and Master.dsk in the ~/.linapple directory.
If not found it looks in the start directory.

Neither of these files are required for operation, but linapple.conf is needed to change video modes, define joysticks, and etc.

For Joysticks you can define which Joystick index number, axis number, and buttons.

Default for Joystick 1 is index 0, axis 0 and 1, buttons 0 and 1.
Default for Joystick 2 is index 1, axis 0 and 1, button 0.


	Joy0Index	=	0
	Joy1Index	=	1
	Joy0Button1	=	0
	Joy0Button2	=	1
	Joy1Button1	=	0
	Joy0Axis0	=	0
	Joy0Axis1	=	1
	Joy1Axis0	=	0
	Joy1Axis1	=	1
