# linapple-pie
Port of linapple2b optimized for front end usage.
This is another conversion on linapple geared toward retropie.
Changes done by Mark Ormond.

Now needs SDL_image to compile.

Changes are as follows.

The sdl mouse cursor is disabled.

The charset40.bmp, font.bmp, and splash.bmp have now been encoded in the
main executable. So no need for these files anymore.

Added the -1 swtich for mounting and running a disk in drive 1. Usage is

linapple -1 /home/pi/Retropie/roms/apple2/Frogger.dsk
