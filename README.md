# linapple-pie for the Apple II Mini
Port of linapple-pie optimized for the Apple II Mini.

The Apple II Mini uses a low resolution (320x240) screen, and the disk chooser included in the original source was unreadable.  I have slightly modified the code a bit to make it much more readable on the tiny screen.

Changes done by Chris Larkin.
